## A few things have changed

### We now know ...

---

## 1. Most people only install apps when they buy their phone

---

## 2. Most people only use common apps and no other

---

## 3. The web platform has now got APIs for previously native-only features

</section>
</section>

<!-- =========================================================== -->

## Best of the Web, and best of apps

  1. Reliability

  Integral code installed on the device

  2. Speed

  Fast Startup, customisable cacheing and offline

  3. User Engagement

  Traditionally native app features like push notifications and GPS

  4. Integrated

  Shows on the home screen and loading as a full-screen app

## Let's consider a few situations

---

## The train journey ...

Content doesn't know about network service

---

## I use this every day ...

Home screen visibility and easy access is important

---

## Mobile Data is Expensive ...

Download on WiFi, experience offline

</section>
</section>

## Secure

Progressive Web Apps can only be run and installed over a secure connection

Service workers work like a proxy and can completely change the response to any request

This makes sure that any service worker that gets installed hasn't been tampered with

## Service Workers

Control how requests are routed. Sit between browser and server.

They don't rely on the website being open, you can define what events wake it up

Push messages can wake up a service worker

Limited to scope dictated by the folder the file is in

---

```
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  navigator.serviceWorker
    .register('/sw.js')
    .then(function() {
      console.log('Service Worker Registered');
    });
}
```
---

```
var cacheName = 'myApp-v1';
self.addEventListener('install', function(e) {
  console.log('[ServiceWorker] Install');
  e.waitUntil(
    caches.open(cacheName).then(function(cache) {
      console.log('[ServiceWorker] Caching app shell');
      return cache.addAll(filesToCache);
    });
  );
});
```

---

```
var filesToCache = [
  '/',
  '/index.html',
  '/scripts/app.js'
];
```

---

```
self.addEventListener('fetch', function(e) {
  console.log('[ServiceWorker] Fetch', e.request.url);
  e.respondWith(
    caches.match(e.request).then(function(response) {
      return response || fetch(e.request);
    })
  );
});
```

## Manifest

Control how app appears to the user on the phone

Control how the app launches

Android will automatically detect a PWA and notify the user they can add it to their home screen

</section>
</section>

<!-- =========================================================== -->

<section>
<section data-markdown data-separator="---" data-background="">

## App Shell

The minimal amount of code needed to show meaningful content to the user

This can also include cached data saved inside a local database
