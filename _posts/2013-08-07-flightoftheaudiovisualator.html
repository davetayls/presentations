## The Source

 - load an audio file in to an audio element
 - load an audio file in to a buffer
 - create waves with oscillators
 - connect an audio stream from a microphone

---

## Load an mp3 file into an Audio element

We need an audio element:

    var audio = new Audio();
    audio.autoplay = true;

Give it a src:

    audio.src = 'joining-the-dots.mp3';

---

## Have a listen

[Play Simple Audio element](code-examples/play-audio-element.html)

---

## The Stack

The `AudioContext` is much like a guitar effects
board.

![connect](connect.png)

Each "effect" on the board can connect to the next

---

## Creating waves with Oscillators

First we need a context.

Our Oscillator can be created out of the context.

We then just need to connect up the wires
to our end destination (speakers).

    var context = new AudioContext();
    var oscillator = context.createOscillator();
    oscillator.connect(context.destination);

---

## What waves can we create?

Using the `type` property we have 4 options.

![oscillator types](waves.jpg)

0: Sine, 1: Square, 2: Triangle, 3: Sawtooth

---

## I want to play a tune

Ok, so you can then set the frequency of the wave.

    oscillator.type = 0;
    oscillator.frequency.value = 440; // A

## Hooking up a microphone using `getUserMedia`

    navigator.getUserMedia({audio: true},
      function(stream) {
        var microphone
          = context.createMediaStreamSource(stream);
        microphone.connect(analyser);
        analyser.connect(javascriptNode);
        microphone.connect(context.destination);
      }, function(){
        throw new Error('Something went wrong');
      }
    );

## The Analyser

The core of our site was analysing the audio frequencies

![spectrum](spectrum.png)

---

## How we react to the frequenices

 - Listen for average and max volume over particular
   frequencies
 - If low frequency band is above a trigger level
   extra visual boost is applied
 - Size of the spheres corresponds to levels at each
   band
 - State of last band saved to give history through
   the cube
 - We also use perlin noise function to gradually
   cycle through colours

---

## Getting the frequencies from the context

Analyser splits up the signal into frequency buckets

    analyser = context.createAnalyser();
    analyser.smoothingTimeConstant=0.3;
    analyser.fftSize=1024;

Process the audio after frames have been sampled

    javascriptNode.onaudioprocess = function(){
      var frequencies
        = new Uint8Array(analyser.frequencyBinCount);
      analyser.getByteFrequencyData(frequencies);
    }
