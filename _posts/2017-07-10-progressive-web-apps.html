## A few things have changed

### We now know ...

---

## 1. Most people only install apps when they buy their phone

---

## 2. Most people only use common apps and no other

---

## 3. The web platform has now got APIs for previously native-only features

## Let's consider a few situations

---

## The train journey

Content doesn't know about network service

Speed - Intermittent - Offline

---

## I use this every day

Home screen visibility and easy access is important

Engagement - Visibility - Convenience

---

## Mobile Data is Expensive, Money and Time

Download on WiFi, experience offline

Other Countries - £££ Expensive Data - ⏰ 2G Connections

## Secure

 - Progressive Web Apps can only be run and installed over a secure connection
 - Service workers work like a proxy and can completely change the response to any request
 - This makes sure that any service worker that gets installed hasn't been tampered with

## App Shell

 - The structural elements of the application
 - Doesn't include content

</section>
</section>

## Service Workers

 - Control how requests are routed. Sit between browser and server.
 - They don't rely on the website being open, you can define what events wake it up
 - Push messages can wake up a service worker
 - Limited to scope dictated by the folder the file is in
 - Can be added without affecting unsupported browsers

---

```
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  navigator.serviceWorker
    .register('/sw.js')
    .then(function() {
      console.log('Service Worker Registered');
    });
}
```
---

```
var cacheName = 'myApp-v1';
self.addEventListener('install', function(e) {
  console.log('[ServiceWorker] Install');
  e.waitUntil(
    caches.open(cacheName).then(function(cache) {
      console.log('[ServiceWorker] Caching app shell');
      return cache.addAll(filesToCache);
    });
  );
});
```

---

```
var filesToCache = [
  '/',
  '/index.html',
  '/scripts/app.js'
];
```

---

```
self.addEventListener('fetch', function(e) {
  console.log('[ServiceWorker] Fetch', e.request.url);
  e.respondWith(
    caches.match(e.request).then(function(response) {
      return response || fetch(e.request);
    })
  );
});
```

## Manifest

 - Control how app appears to the user on the phone
 - Control how the app launches
 - Android will automatically detect a PWA and notify the user they can add it to their home screen

---

## Link to the manifest

```html
< link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json" >
```

---

```json
{
  "name": "Superhero",
  "start_url": ".",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#fff",
  "description": "Wear a cape, change the world",
  "icons": [{
    "src": "images/homescreen48.png",
    "sizes": "48x48",
    "type": "image/png"
  }]
}
```

## Best of the Web, and best of apps

1. Reliability

Integral code installed on the device

2. Speed

Fast Startup, customisable cacheing and offline

3. User Engagement

Traditionally native app features like push notifications and GPS

4. Integrated

Shows on the home screen and loading as a full-screen app
