## Intro

  * Hello! I'm Dave Taylor
  * https://davetayls.me
  * Software Engineer for 16 years
  * Working with digital teams across the globe
  * Start-ups to multi-billion e-commerce
  * Tech Lead at Seccl, 5 devs, right here in Bath


Notes:

  Hi everyone, my name is Dave.

  When I was 19 I had a terrible job, I ended up throwing
  bluetac at my computer screen for fun.

  I've been a software engineer for the last 16 years
  and I'm currently the Tech lead at Seccl in Bath.
  We're a small start up company, 5 devs on my team.

  I'm here to talk about Serverless, so, why might you be here?

  * quite a big shift to the way people release that's only become viable within the last few years
  * massive risk to take something on
  * new stuff is hard and really painful, this has been no exception to the rule
  * there's no guarantee of success, but without trying and risking you'll never know

## So this is what I hope you'll get out of today!

  * What have we achieved at Seccl?
  * What are the pinch points?
  * Who is this for?

Thanks for taking time out to come and hear me, here we go!

## What is Serverless Framework

Infrastructure as code

Simplified deployment of separate functions

Provider agnostic

Notes:


  Serverless framework is an open-source cli for building
  and deploying serverless applications

  Serverless applications are ones where you don't manage any of
  your own infrastructure

  It allows you to define the infrastructure you need your
  code to run on alongside the application code itself
  
  Your provider will deal with connecting everything up.

  Serverless Framework isn't tied to any particular provider,
  you can deploy to Google Cloud, AWS, Azure, IBM and Kubernetes

## What have we achieved

Seccl is a startup in Bath pioneering a new breed
of digital services for wealth management

* Node.js, TypeScript, React, Express APIs
* Serverless Framework on AWS
* APIs, pubsub, queues, functions, static websites, cdn
* ## 90% of our infrastructure (and rising) is controlled by code!
  
Notes:

  We are a startup based in Bath pioneering a new breed of
  digital services for wealth management.

  With our little team we work with Serverless Framework to deploy
  Node.js applications to our AWS cloud.

  We deploy a tonne of things through a simple text config

  - APIs and their endpoints
  - Pub Sub events
  - Queues and their Job processors
  - Functions
  - Static websites and React apps
  - CDN configuration

  We use Node.js and TypeScript across most of our codebase

  Serverless allows custom plugins to be added which are not
  too hard to get going with.

  We tag and package our deployments, with our dev team of 5
  we deploy 29 serverless projects across 4 products at least
  once a week and a full deployment of our stack takes about an
  hour and this is decreasing as we optimise our tooling

  90% of our infrastructure is controlled by code and that is
  slowly rising.

## Development Lifecycle
Notes:

  So let's look at a simple development lifecycle

### Configure

```
service:
  name: helloEverybody
provider:
  name: aws
functions:
  helloWorld:
    handler: index.handler
```

### Deploy

```
sls deploy
```

Notes:

  We configure our Serverless service through a yaml config

  Define our provider and any functions which need to be deployed

---
  
```
Serverless: Uploading CloudFormation file to S3...
Serverless: Uploading artifacts...
Serverless: Validating template...
Serverless: Updating Stack...
Serverless: Checking Stack update progress...
..................
Serverless: Stack update finished...
Service Information
service: pfolio-api
stage: staging
region: eu-west-1
stack: pfolio-api-staging
endpoints:
  ANY - https://xyz.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/staging
  ANY - https://xyz.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/staging/{proxy+}
functions:
  app: pfolio-api-staging-app
```

Notes:

  In AWS, what this has done is created a cloud formation template
  for our project.

  Cloud Formation is AWS service for declaratively defining your
  infrastructure as code

  It is clever enough to diff changes when you update the template
  and update your infrastructure with minimal side-effects
  
---
  
### Deploy a function

```
sls deploy function -f helloWorld
```

### Invoke a function and log the output

```
serverless invoke -f hello -l
```

Notes:

  We can also deploy individual functions and see their logs

---

### Cleanup
  
```
serverless remove
```

Notes:

  And when we are finished, we can clean it all up.

# What are the pinch points

How easy is it actually?

Notes:

  Here's the rub! There has been pain

  Deployment is needed to fully test end-to-end and that can slow things down

  Our workflow is heavily unit test focused so this helps but when
  it gets to testing the integration in our dev environments you do have
  to deploy.

  The offline capabilities aren't a silver bullet, when you start to link
  functions together you could still have some functions running in the cloud
  and some locally

  What about lambda?

  - we use aws and so that means lambda
  - building compiled code to run in a different architecture
  - Cold start when you run lamda inside a VPC is really painful (up to 9 secs)
  - When it goes wrong, your head can explode as to where to start looking
  - Sometimes it's completely out of your ability to fix

# Who is this for

# üëç

  - For any application logic which can be easily spun up, and then powered down
  - It works really well for APIs which talk to a database or other APIs
  - It works great for a micro-service like architecture
  - For teams with little devops specialist skills

Notes:

For any application logic which can be easily spun up, and then powered down

It works really well for APIs which talk to a database or other APIs

It works great for a micro-service like architecture

If you have no devops person, there is no infrastructure to worry about which is a MASSIVE weight off your mind

# üí©

 - You can't be afraid of a learning-curve
 - You can't work with a full framework like Rails
 - For someone who wants a silver bullet and a holiday in Hawaii


Notes:

You do need to be willing to face the learning curve, it's young so there are still a lot
of confusing answers out there and different ways of doing the same thing.

If you want to work with a "monolith" framework like rails then it won't suit you

You do swap complexities and problems for others so you won't be getting that holiday
in hawaii as quick as you'd like

# Roundup

  üí™ Infrastructure as Code

  üí™ Replica environments

  üò± Everything is separated. It's different complexity

  üò± Slow cold starts

  üí™ No maintaining hardware

  üí™ Serverless plugins to fill the gaps

Notes:

  Sum up
  we've done some cool stuff
  it's been painful but it's also helped
  you need to think, is this for you
