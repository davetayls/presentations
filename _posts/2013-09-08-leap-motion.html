## JavaScript

Leap Motion JavaScript support has two main components.

1. WebSocket server (JSON-formatted messages)
2. JavaScript client library, Leap.js

---

## Coordinate System

![axes](leap_axes.png)

 - real world units (millimeters)

## Frames and data

 - sends a frame of data up to 60 frames per second
 - tracks hands, fingers, tools and gestures
 - elements are assigned a unique id for as long as they are in view

---

## Lists of tracking data in a frame

 - Hands — All hands.
 - Pointables — All fingers and tools as Pointable objects.
 - Fingers — All the fingers.
 - Tools — All the tools.
 - Gestures — All the gestures that started, ended, or which had an update.

---

## Motion and Frame Motion

You get factors based on however many hands detected
in the view.

 - translation
 - rotation
 - scale

For the frame this means you don't have to track hands individually.

## Hand

 - `palmPosition` — The center of the palm measured in millimeters from the Leap origin.
 - `palmVelocity` — The speed of the palm in millimeters per second.
 - `palmNormal` — A vector perpendicular to the plane formed by the palm of the hand. The vector points downward out of the palm.
 - `direction` — A vector pointing from the center of the palm toward the fingers.

---

## Hand Sphere

![hand sphere](leap_hand_ball.png)

 - `sphereCenter` — The center of a sphere fit to the curvature of the hand (as if it were holding a ball).
 - `sphereRadius` — The radius of a sphere fit to the curvature of the hand. The radius changes with the shape of the hand.

## Pointables (Fingers and Tools)

 - `length` — The length of the visible portion of the object (from where it extends out of the hand to the tip).
 - `width` — The average width of the visible portion of the object.
 - `direction` — A unit direction vector pointing in the same direction as the object (i.e. from base to tip).
 - `tipPosition` — The position of the tip in millimeters from the Leap origin.
 - `tipVelocity` — The speed of the tip in millimeters per second.

## Gestures and Taps

For each gesture observed, the Leap adds a Gesture object to the
frame. You can get these Gesture objects from the Frame `gestures` list.

 - Circle — A single finger tracing a circle.
 - Swipe — A linear movement of the hand.
 - Key Tap — A tapping movement by a finger as if tapping a keyboard key.
 - Screen Tap — A tapping movement by the finger as if tapping a vertical computer screen.

## Creating the Frame loop

    Leap.loop(function(frame){
        // frame.hands
        // frame.fingers
        // frame.tools
        // frame.gestures
    });
