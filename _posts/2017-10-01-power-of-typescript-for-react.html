# Components and Contracts

### The React community is very focussed on small components

  * great for scaling
  * sharing code
  * A/B testing

# TypeScript 101

---

### Some simple types

```javascript
const s: string = 'string'
const n: number = 100
const arr: number[] = [1,2,3,4]
const fn: (name: string) => string =
(name: string) => `Hello ${name}`;
```

---

### TypeScript can infer a lot

```javascript
const s = 'string'
const n = 100
const arr: number[] = [1,2,3,4]
const fn = (name: string) => `Hello ${name}`;
```

# Pure or Presentational Components

---

## Component props

  * Define the props a component needs
  * Specify which props are optional
  * Be specific about the types of props

---

```javascript
export interface IPersonProps {
  // these first props are required
  name: string;
  age: number;
  // the question mark here tells
  // the compiler that the skills
  // array is optional
  skills?: string[];
  // We can define a function to be
  // called when an event happens
  // within the component.
  onSelectedSkill?: (skill: string) => any;
}
```

---

## Specifying Props and State

```jsx
class Person extends
  React.Component&ltIPersonProps, IPersonState&gt; {
  render() { /* ... */ }
}
```

---

```jsx
render() {
  return (
    &lt;section&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;
        My name is {this.props.name}
      &lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;
        I am {this.props.age} years old
      &lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;h4&gt;My Skills are:&lt;/h4&gt;
      {this.getSkills()}
    &lt;/section&gt;
  );
}
```

---

## Spot the potential runtime error

```jsx
getSkills() {
  if (this.props.skills.length) {
    const skills = this.props.skills
      .map((skill: string, i: number) =>
        (&lt;li key={i}>{skill}&lt;/li>)
      );
    return &lt;ul>{skills}&lt;/ul>;
  }
}
```

---

## TypeScript will give the error:

```javascript
Object is possibly 'undefined'.
(property) IPersonProps.skills: string[] | undefined
```

---

## No Errors

```jsx
getSkills() {
  if (this.props.skills && this.props.skills.length) {
    const skills = this.props.skills
      .map((skill: string, i: number) =>
        (&lt;li key={i}>{skill}&lt;/li>)
      );
    return &lt;ul>{skills}&lt;/ul>;
  }
}
```

 - Define the props a component needs
 - Specify which props are optional
 - Be specific about the types of props

# Connected Components

 - separate interfaces for props and dispatch for redux connect
 - joining them together with intersection types

---

### Separating interface definitions for Props and Dispatch

```js
export interface IPersonProps {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  skills?: string[];
}

// Our event related functions are
// moved into this separate dispatch
// interface
export interface IPersonDispatch {
  onSelecedSkill?: (skill: string) => any;
}
```

---

### We use the `&` to combine types.

### This is called an Intersection Type

```jsx
export class Person
  extends React.Component&lt;
    IPersonProps & IPersonDispatch,
    IPersonState> {
}
```

---

## Tightening generic functions

The `connect` function from `react-redux` expects two functions like this

```js
type mapStateToProps =
  (state: IAppState) => object;
type mapDispatchToProps =
  (dispatch: Dispatch) => object;
```

---

## Tightening generic functions

We now have the interfaces we need to be more specific

```js
type mapStateToProps =
  (state: IAppState) => IPersonProps;
type mapDispatchToProps =
  (dispatch: Dispatch) => IPersonDispatch;
```

---

```js
export const PersonWithState = connect(
  (state: IAppState): IPersonProps => ({
    name: state.currentPerson.name,
    age: state.currentPerson.age,
    skills: state.currentPerson.skills
  }),
  (dispatch): IPersonDispatch => ({
    onSelecedSkill: (skill) => {
      dispatch(selectedSkill(skill))
    }
  })
)(Person);
```

---

 - TS tells us what code should be updated when props change
 - TS makes working with components you have not created easier because the interfaces act like docs

# Actions

---

It useful to make all actions have the same basic structure

 - Generic
 - Positive
 - Error
 - Any or unknown

---

```javascript
// We have an action with customisable payload and meta
export interface IGenericAction&lt;T, P, M> {
  // Our type is a const string
  type: T;
  // The payload can be anything but will be
  // specified for a particular action within
  // the app
  payload?: P;
  // The meta property can be used to send
  // further information along with the action
  // often used by redux middleware
  meta?: M;
  // This is a flag to tell if the payload
  // is an error
  error?: boolean;
}
```

---

## Positive

```csharp
interface IAction&lt;T, P>
  extends IGenericAction&lt;T, P, undefined> {}

const AUTHENTICATE = 'AUTHENTICATE';

export interface IAuthenticate {
  username: string;
  password: string;
}

type AuthenticateAction =
  IAction&lt;
    typeof AUTHENTICATE,
    IAuthenticate>;
```

---

## Error

```csharp
interface IErrorAction&lt;T, P extends IError>
  extends IGenericAction&lt;T, P, any> {}

type AuthenticateErrorAction =
  IErrorAction&lt;typeof AUTHENTICATE_ERROR, ResponseError>
```

---

## Any or unknown

```csharp
interface IAnyAction
  extends IGenericAction&lt;string, any, any> {}
```

---

```js
export interface IAuthenticationState {
  authenticating: boolean;
}
// Top level reducer
export function authenticateReducer(state: IAuthenticationState, action: IAnyAction) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case AUTHENTICATE: return credentials(state, action);
    default: return state;
  }
}
// Function reducer
export function credentials(state: IAuthenticationState, action: AuthenticateAction) {
  const {payload} = action;
  return {
    ...state,
    authenticating: payload.username
  };
}
```

---

 - TS helps us keep structured Actions (Generic, Positive, Error, Any)
 - TS ensures our action creators output what is expected
 - TS allows us to check the payload of an action when writing the reducer

# Reducers

---

## Planning our state

How might we plan the structure of our resulting state

```csharp
interface IAppState {
  authentication: IAuthenticationState;
  entities: IEntitiesState;
}
```

---

## Entities

We can picture our entities

```csharp
interface IEntitiesState {
  [entityName:string]: IEntityState;

  // You can define specific entities
  // if you know of them
  posts: IEntityState;
  comments: IEntityState;
  authors: IEntityState;
}
```

---

## Single Entity

```csharp
interface IEntityState&lt;E> {
  byId: { [id: string]: E };
  all: string[];
}
```

---

## Our Post structure

```csharp
interface IPost {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  body: string;
}
```

---

```csharp
interface IEntitiesState {
  // If the entity is unknown then it's
  // properties could be anything!
  [entityName:string]: IEntityState&lt;any>;

  // For our known entity we can define that the
  // properties will be those defined in the
  // `IPost` interface
  posts: IEntityState&lt;IPost>;
  comments: IEntityState&lt;IComment>;
  authors: IEntityState&lt;IAuthor>;
}
```

---

## What we are gaining here from all this?

```js
let posts = state.entities.posts;
```

 - TS knows the specific post properties ... like `title`
 - TS knows a post has a title `posts.byId[id].title`.
 - Our `IEntitiesState` will give us a form of documentation
 - Any reducers which should return data related to the posts entity are now part of this well defined contract

---

# Mapping the State to Reducers

---

```csharp
interface IAppState {
  authentication: IAuthState; }
```

Combine reducers is a function which

  1. takes that same state (and an action)
  2. returns a state of the same shape

```csharp
interface ICombineReducers {
  authentication: (
    state: IAuthState,
    action: IAnyAction
  ) => IAuthState;
}
```

---

# We don't have to maintain two interfaces!

# ðŸ˜±

---

## Mapped Types

```csharp
type ReducersOn<T> = {
  // For each property P in the object T
  // map the type to a function where
  // the first parameter takes state of the same type T[P]
  // and returns the same type T[P]
  [P in keyof T]: (
    state: T[P],
    action: IAnyAction
  ) => T[P];
};
// And then we can declare our root state object
const rootState: ReducersOn<IAppState> = {
  authentication: authenticationReducer,
}
```

---

 - TS helps us plan our state
 - TS helps ensure we return the correct structure

# Refactoring

---

## Contrived Reducer

```js
export function calculateTotalsReducer(
    state: IAppState,
    action: ChangePlayerAction
  ): IAppState {
    const { playerTurn, stats } = state;
    const player = getPlayer(playerTurn);
    return {
      ...state,
      totalsMessage: `Player ${player.name} has ${stats.roomA + stats.roomB} score across all rooms`
    };
  }
```

Notes:
`playerTurn` is a number here so `getPlayer` grabs the player
details from somewhere else

---

We convert our playerTurn from a simple number to an object

![Refactor our playerTurn to include id](07-react-refactoring-player-turn.gif)

Notes:
We get an error when we call `getPlayer` with the `playerTurn` from the state.

---

Error for our reducer because our action is supplying a number

![Refactor our playerTurn to include id](07-react-refactoring-player-turn-state.png)

Notes:
We will look at each line in the error log next

---

The object type in quotes does not match `IAppState`.

```bash
index.ts(51,3): error TS2322:
  Type '{ playerTurn: number | undefined; stats: IStats;
          totalsMessage: string; }'
  is not assignable to type 'IAppState'.
```

---

The object does not match `IAppState` because of the `playerTurn` property.

```bash
Types of property 'playerTurn' are incompatible.
```

The `playerTurn` property doesn't match because:

you're trying to set it to `number | undefined`

when `IAppState` wants an `IPlayerTurnState`.

```bash
Type 'number | undefined' is not assignable to type 'IPlayerTurnState'.
Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'IPlayerTurnState'.
```

---

We fix the change player reducer ...

```csharp
return {
  ...state,
  playerTurn: { id: action.payload || 0 }
}
```

---

We fix the calculate totals reducer
